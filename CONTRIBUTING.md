## Bug Reports and Issues
Bug Reports are welcome and appreciated! However, due to an influx of poor quality report, we have some processes in place to help.

#### Search for Related Issues
Your bug or issue may have already been reported by another user. Please make sure to search through the "Issues" tab for similar issues to the one you're submitting

#### One Bug/Report per Issue
In order to keep the conversation relevant on an issue and to make issues easier to find, please create one issue per bug that you're encountering. If you're unsure if your issue is two seperate problems or one, err on the side of caution and submit multiple bug reports.

#### Be Responsive
We want to fix problems as fast as possible, but all contributors are volunteers for this project. Please respect their time and be reasonably responsive to questions that a contributor may ask. Issues that don't have a response may be closed if there hasn't been a response for 14 days to keep things clean.

#### Provide Detail
Similar to the prior note, please provide as much information as possible in your initial report. Things like:
- Logs
- Hack Version
- Camera Model
- Camera Version

This helps us diagnose issues faster and provide resolutions. If needed information isn't provided, it's going to get asked for anyways.

## Pull Requests

Code changes and improvements are welcome and encouraged! If you plan on changing a large section of the project (swapping around components, removing features), please file an issue with us so we can discuss a path forward and implementation details.
