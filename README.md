# Custom firmware for Yi home 1080p 6FUS 4.5.0 version (only)

This firmware is completely based on the work done by TheCrypt0
https://github.com/TheCrypt0/yi-hack-v4
It's a clone made only for Yi Home 1080p with fw 4.5.0 based on MStar platform.

I have no time to support the project, so feel free to clone/fork this git and modify it as you want.

## RTSP Server
I'm working on a fully functional RTSP implementation, inspired by the following topic:
- @andy2301 - [Ideas for the RSTP rtsp and rtsp2301](https://github.com/xmflsct/yi-hack-1080p/issues/5#issuecomment-294326131)

The RTSP server code derives from live555 - http://www.live555.com/ and from the archive rtsp2303_srcbin_20170414-1630.zip posted in the link above.
At this moment it's work in progress and untested.

## Supported cameras

Currently this project supports only the following camera:

- Yi 1080p Home 6FUS with firmware 4.5.0.0A or 4.5.0.0B

This firmware is based on 4.5.0.0B and completely overwrite the original firmware.
So, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Getting Started
1. Check that you have a correct Xiaomi Yi camera.

2. Get a microSD card, 16gb or less, and format it by selecting File System as FAT32.

3. Save both files (home_y203c and sys_y203c) on root path of microSD card.

4. Remove power to the camera, insert the microSD card, turn the power back ON.

5. The yellow light will come ON and flash for roughly 30 seconds, which means the firmware is being flashed successfully. The camera will boot up.

6. The yellow light will come ON again for the final stage of flashing. This will take up to 2 minutes.

7. Blue light should come ON indicating that your WiFi connection has been successful (if not disable using app).

8. Go in the browser and access the web interface of the camera as a website. Find the IP address using your mobile app (Camera Settings --> Network Info --> IP Address).

10. Done.

## Build your own firmware
If you want to build your own firmware, clone this git and compile using a linux machine.
Quick explanation:
- Download and install the SDK for MStar platform: the file name is "MStar MSC3XX SDK.zip" (Google is your friend).
- Prepare the system installing all the necessary packages.
- Copy home and rootfs partition files to ./stock_firmware/yi_home_1080p
- ./scripts/init_sysroot.all.sh
- ./scripts/compile.sh
- ./scripts/pack_fw.all.sh
